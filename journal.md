You did perfect at explaining instructions, And all of the instructions were not confusing.
No i did not run into any problems when folowing instructions, I don't think i missed anything.

The sensors that i searched up are gyroscope, accelerometer, and velocity.
The one that i thought was intresting was velocity cause it's hard to find velocity as a human but as an ai it's not hard at all. And i find it intresting that ai's are more advanced than us even though we are the ones that made ai.

I use alot of computer science in fact i use so much, most of the time i don't even know that i'm using it. I'm always playing games and i always wondered how long or how hard is it to code video games, so i decided that i was gonna see how hard or how long it takes to code a video game.

I think that code combat is easier to use because it explains to me completely and if i still don't understand then it will give me hints on how to do it.
Block coding didn't really help all that much i mostly learned from code combat i believe that code combat is easier and i can use it easily.
I think that i had more control on code combat because i could move them freely and deliberatley.

Coding helps you with your problem solving skills by helping you learn to analyze all of your options when you're stuck in a pickle.

I learned that you always need help when you do something super dumb and need help to hide/fix it is whatever you've done.
